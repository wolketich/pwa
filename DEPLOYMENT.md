## âœ… Post-Deployment Verification

   - Test offline functionality
   - Verify all features work

2. **PWA Audit**:

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Install prompt not showing:**

- Verify service worker is registered

**Icons not loading:**
- Make sure `icons/` folder exists with all icon files
- Check file paths in manifest.json
- Verify icon sizes match manifest

**Offline not working:**
- Check service worker registration in browser dev tools
- Verify files are being cached
- Test with browser dev tools â†’ Application â†’ Service Workers
